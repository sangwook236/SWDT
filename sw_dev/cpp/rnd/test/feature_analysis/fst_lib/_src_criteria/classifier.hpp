   \brief   Defines interface for classifier implementations
   \author  Petr Somol (somol@utia.cas.cz) with collaborators, see Contacts at http://fst.utia.cz
   \date    March 2011
   \version 3.1.0.beta
   \note    FST3 was developed using gcc 4.3 and requires
   \note    \li Boost library (http://www.boost.org/, tested with versions 1.33.1 and 1.44),
   \note    \li (\e optionally) LibSVM (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/, 
                tested with version 3.00)
   \note    Note that LibSVM is required for SVM related tools only,
            as demonstrated in demo12t.cpp, demo23.cpp, demo25t.cpp, demo32t.cpp, etc.

/*============== Template parameter type naming conventions ==============
--------- Numeric types: -------------------------------------------------
DATATYPE - data sample values - usually real numbers (but may be integers
          in text processing etc.)
REALTYPE - must be real numbers - for representing intermediate results of 
          calculations like mean, covariance etc.
IDXTYPE - index values for enumeration of data samples - (nonnegative) integers, 
          extent depends on numbers of samples in data
DIMTYPE - index values for enumeration of features (dimensions), or classes (not 
          class sizes) - (nonnegative) integers, usually lower extent than IDXTYPE, 
          but be aware of expressions like _classes*_features*_features ! 
          in linearized representations of feature matrices for all classes
BINTYPE - feature selection marker type - represents ca. <10 different feature 
          states (selected, deselected, sel./desel. temporarily 1st nested loop, 2nd...)
RETURNTYPE - criterion value: real value, but may be extended in future to support 
          multiple values 
--------- Class types: ---------------------------------------------------
SUBSET       - class of class type Subset 
CLASSIFIER   - class implementing interface defined in abstract class Classifier 
EVALUATOR    - class implementing interface defined in abstract class Sequential_Step 
DISTANCE     - class implementing interface defined in abstract class Distance 
DATAACCESSOR - class implementing interface defined in abstract class Data_Accessor 
INTERVALCONTAINER - class of class type TIntervaller 
CONTAINER    - STL container of class type TInterval
