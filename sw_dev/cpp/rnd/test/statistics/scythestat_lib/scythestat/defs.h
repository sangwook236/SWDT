/*! \mainpage Scythe Statistical Library: Application Programmers' Interface
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * The Scythe Statistical Library is an open source C++ library for
 * statistical computation, written by Daniel Pemstein (University of
 * Mississippi), Kevin M. Quinn (University of California Berkeley),
 * and Andrew D.  Martin (Washington University). It includes a suite
 * of matrix manipulation functions, a suite of pseudo-random number
 * generators, and a suite of numerical optimization routines.
 * Programs written using Scythe are generally much faster than those
 * written in commonly used interpreted languages, such as R and
 * MATLAB, and can be compiled on any system with the GNU GCC compiler
 * (and perhaps with other C++ compilers). One of the primary design
 * goals of the Scythe developers has been ease of use for non-expert
 * C++ programmers. We provide ease of use through three primary
 * mechanisms: (1) operator and function over-loading, (2) numerous
 * pre-fabricated utility functions, and (3) clear documentation and
 * example programs. Additionally, Scythe is quite flexible and
 * entirely extensible because the source code is available to all
 * users under the GNU General Public License.
 *
 * \section thisdoc About This Document
 *
 * This document is the application programmer's interface (API) to
 * Scythe.  It provides documentation for every class, function, and
 * object in Scythe that is part of the library's public interface.
 * In addition, the sections below explain how to obtain, install, and
 * compile the library.
 *
 * \section obtain Obtaining Scythe
 *
 * The most recent version of Scythe is available for download at
 * http://scythe.wustl.edu.
 *
 * \section install Installation
 * 
 * Scythe installs as a header-only C++ library.  After uncompressing,
 * simply follow the instructions in the INSTALL file included with
 * Scythe to install the library.  Alternatively, you may copy the
 * source files in scythestat and scythestat/rng into your project
 * directory and compile directly, using the SCYTHE_COMPILE_DIRECT
 * pre-processor flag.
 *
 * \section compile Compilation
 *
 * Scythe should work with the GNU GCC compiler, version 4.4.7 and
 * greater.  Scythe has not been tested with other compilers.  Scythe
 * provides a number of pre-processor flags.  The
 * SCYTHE_COMPILE_DIRECT flag allows the user to compile Scythe sources
 * directly.  The SCYTHE_VIEW_ASSIGNMENT_FLAG flag turns on R-style
 * recycling in Matrix::operator=() for view matrices. 
 *
 * The SCYTHE_DEBUG flag controls the amount of error trapping in Scythe.
 * This level ranges from 0 (virtually no checking) to 3 (all
 * checking, including Matrix bounds checking, turned on).  By
 * default, the level is set to 3.  Reducing the error check level can
 * substantially improve performance.  Here's an example of how to
 * compile a program with only basic error checking:
 *
 * \verbatim $ g++ myprog.cc -DSCYTHE_DEBUG=1 \endverbatim
 *
 * The SCYTHE_LAPACK flag enables LAPACK/BLAS support.  You must have
 * the LAPACK and BLAS libraries installed on your system and compile
 * your program with the appropriate linker flags for this to work.
 * For example, on linux you can enable LAPACK/BLAS support like this:
 *
 * \verbatim $ g++ myprog.cc -DSCYTHE_LAPACK -llapack -lblas -pthread \endverbatim
 *
 * The SCYTHE_PTHREAD flag makes the library thread-safe, using the
 * POSIX Threads library.  Users should pass this flag to the compiler
 * whenever they wish to run multi-threaded code that uses Scythe
 * matrices.  Of course, this will only work on systems sporting the
 * pthread libraries.  For example:
 *
 * \verbatim g++ myprog.cc -DSCYTHE_PTHREAD -pthread \endverbatim
 *
 * Please note that Scythe matrices are NOT thread-safe when the
 * library is compiled without this flag.
 *
 * Finally, the SCYTHE_RPACK flag activates some code that makes
 * Scythe play nicely with the R statistical programming environment.
 * R packages that use Scythe should always use this compilation flag,
 * and will generally include a line similar to
 * \verbatim PKG_CPPFLAGS = -DSCYTHE_COMPILE_DIRECT -DSCYTHE_RPACK \endverbatim
 * in the src/Makevars.in file within the package.
